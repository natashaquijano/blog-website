            <p class="article-paragraph">Ten years ago, we sold, donated, or discarded over 60% of our possessions.
                <br />
                <br />
                We discarded clothes, decorations, cookware, furniture, linens, tools, books, toys, plus anything else
                we could find in
                our home that was not immediately useful or beautiful.
                <br />
                <br />
                At the time, the idea of becoming minimalist was foreign to us. Nobody had ever told us that
                intentionally living with
                fewer possessions was an option for life chosen by many. Nor had I ever considered how owning less might
                be a better
                alternative to the endless pursuit of more.
                <br />
                <br />
                Looking back, while I would have never admitted that I was seeking joy in possessions, I had certainly
                become more
                influenced by a consumer-driven society than I would like to admit. As a result, just like most, I
                worked long hours to
                earn more money to buy a bigger house, a faster car, newer technology, trendier clothing, and nicer
                toys. I didn’t
                really believe the purpose of life was to chase possessions, but my calendar and checkbook sure seemed
                to declare that
                truth.
                <br />
                <br />
                As Will Rogers once said, I had become busy "spending money I hadn't earned, to buy things I didn't
                want, just to
                impress people I didn't like."
                <br />
                <br />
                However, once introduced to the idea of minimalism, choosing to intentionally live with less sounded
                surprisingly
                attractive.
                <br />
                <br />
                My decision found its roots in my finances, my family, and my faith. I had grown weary of living
                paycheck to paycheck,
                weary of trading time with my kids to manage my stuff, and weary of pursuing worldly gain rather than
                lasting purpose.
                <br />
                <br />
                Owning less offered escape from the clutter in my home. But more than that, it offered escape from the
                clutter in my
                life. It reintroduced intentionality and alignment. And it offered the very ideals my heart most
                desperately desired.
                <br />
                <br />
                Since choosing minimalism, I have experienced numerous benefits. I have more time, more energy, more
                freedom, and more
                money to pursue what is most important to me. Owning less means less cleaning, less burden, less
                anxiety, and less
                stress every day. I have found more opportunity to pursue my greatest passions.
                <br />
                <br />
                Over the years, I have come to define minimalism as the intentional promotion of the things we most
                value and the
                removal of everything that distracts us from it. I have found minimalism to be a lifestyle that appeals
                to the heart and
                resonates with the soul. It may look different from person to person, but I have seen it adopted all
                over the world by
                individuals in every stage of life.
                <br />
                <br />
                Owning less is an invitation that is appreciated, desired, and accepted when fully understood.
                <br />
                <br />
                Minimalism is the pathway to the better life you’ve been searching for all along.
                <br />
                <br />
                You'll love owning less.
